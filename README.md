This is a repo that was created to support me and my group with keeping the 14 mandatory assignments for the course, *Programs as Data,* organized.

# How to navigate

We have chosen to create a new branch for each assignment.
The naming standard for these branches is: “Assignment{x}” where the assignment number is inserted in place of the “{x}”.
